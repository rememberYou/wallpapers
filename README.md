Personal Wallpapers
===============================

This repository addresses two issues:
1. Being able to export my wallpapers to other machines with variable screen
   resolutions, without taking my hard drive with me.
2. Being able to prevent some people from still asking me about the wallpapers I

### File Tracking ###

I opted for [Git LFS](https://git-lfs.github.com/) the choice recommended by

### Supported Resolutions ###

Images are sorted by resolution, this makes it easier to export wallpapers that
I like depending on the resolution of the screen I use.

 2560x1440 ➔ includes all wallpapers that I use with my Lenovo ThinkPad X1 Carbon
 3840x2160 ➔ includes all wallpapers that I use with my 4K monitor
```

It should be noted that the vast majority of wallpapers are in JPG format which
is preferable since this is a lossy compressed file format.
